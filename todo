1. Research python keyboard interaction

Using Keyboard or PyAutoGUI


2. Feed shared_data.py into python interaction script

Each Agent is going to have it's own thread
I need to move the updating for the player class from the game.py file to the threaded function
Then within each thread it will update the shared_data.py file
Game.py will no longer do anything but display the level and the Agents on it using shared_data.py


3. Think about how to train AI

How should the AI decide when and how to move?

4. Profit
